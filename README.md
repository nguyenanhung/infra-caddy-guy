little simpler and easier.

## Scope of Workflow

The purpose of this script is to simplify the installation process, especially for projects running standalone servers
or staging, dev environments.

It may not be suitable for cloud auto-scaling, because I don't really intend to deploy it that way. Implementing
auto-scaling requires a higher level of IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

### OS Support

- [x] RHEL Based: CentOS, Almalinux, Rocky Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- [x] Fedora based
- [x] Ubuntu/Debian
- [x] Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2023

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nguyenanhung/infra-caddy-guy.git && cd infra-caddy-guy && ./bin/enable-shortcut
```

and use it

```bash
infra-caddy introduce
```

## Guidelines

### Important note

#### If another container needs to connect to the Caddy Web Server network, it needs to connect to the Caddy Web Server network.

##### **Temporary/Short Term: Will be invalidated if restarted or down mode**

> `<container_name>` is the name of the container to connect to.

```shell
# Connect Caddy Network
docker network connect bear_caddy_net <container_name>
```

```shell
# Disconnect Caddy Network
docker network disconnect bear_caddy_net <container_name>
```

##### **Permanent (if using docker-compose)**

Add the network name of the Caddy Web Server to your `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
networks:
    # ...
    bear_caddy_net:
        external: true
    # ...
```
